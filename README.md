========

Based on the open source PDF to HTML converter by Gueorgui Ovtcharov and Rainer Dorsch (which in turn was built upon Derek Noonburg's xpdf package), this repository provides a simple graphical web interface for users. The code can be run on any server with the PDF to HTML software installed.
